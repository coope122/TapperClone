This is the TapperClone game file in its final state

To operate:
- turn on, you should be at a START GAME screen, press KEY[0]
- Now play, player character is Tapper, the brown box on the right. KEY[3] moves Tapper up, KEY[2] down, KEY[1] left, and KEY[0] is used to throw your drinks
- SW[0] is your reset signla
- Each Customer served gives a point, after 12 points (displayed on HEX[2:0]) you will go into the START GAME screen again, but you will notice that you have 2 LEDR's on. This is level 2
- Gameplay procedes until you reach 36 points on level 3 where you win and are met with a green screen, or a customer reaches the end of their table and you lose and are met with a red screen
